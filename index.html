        <h3>I'm back!</h3>
        <p>October 27, 2022</p>
        <p>
            I am back! Today I am restarting my web 
            development journey. I am going to start over
            by using TheOdinProject.com. So far it has been
            a refresher of what I had learned last year but
            I have noticed that it's a deeper dive into the 
            <em>"why"</em> of doing different things in 
            HTML and CSS.

            Back in 2021, I started learning HTML and CSS with 
            <strong>freecodecamp.org</strong>. I made a little 
            progress learning but life got a little busy and I
            had to stop. I will be back though!
